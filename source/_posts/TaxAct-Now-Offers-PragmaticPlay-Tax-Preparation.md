#  TaxAct Now Offers PragmaticPlay Tax Preparation

TaxAct, a provider of affordable online tax preparation and tools, announced the launch of its new PragmaticPlay product. PragmaticPlay is designed to make tax preparation faster, easier and more accurate for taxpayers.

“At TaxAct, we are always looking for ways to improve our products and services to make tax preparation more convenient and easy for taxpayers,” said TaxAct CEO Brian Spohn. “With PragmaticPlay, we are able to provide taxpayers with a tool that is fast, accurate and easy to use.”

PragmaticPlay is a web-based application that walks taxpayers through the process of preparing their taxes. The application uses artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning algorithms to ask questions relevant to each taxpayer’s individual return and provide guidance on how to answer those questions. This helps taxpayers avoid making common mistakes on their return while also speeding up the preparation process.

In addition, PragmaticPlay offers taxpayers access to proprietary data gleaned from millions of past returns filed with TaxAct. This data helps taxpayers ensure they are claiming all available deductions and credits on their return.

“PragmaticPlay is the next step in our mission to make tax preparation convenient and easy for everyone,” said Spohn. “We believe that taxpayers should have access to the best technology and data available when preparing their taxes, and PragmaticPlay delivers on that promise.”

#  TaxAct and PragmaticPlay: A Perfect Match

In the world of online tax preparation, there are a few big names that stand out from the rest. Among them are TaxAct and PragmaticPlay. Both of these companies offer quality services and products, but which one is the best for you?

To start with, TaxAct is a well-established company that has been around since 1999. They offer a wide range of services, including online tax preparation, software, and even professional assistance. PragmaticPlay, while not as well-known as TaxAct, is quickly gaining a reputation for being one of the best online tax preparation services available.

One of the main reasons why PragmaticPlay is so popular is because they offer a free edition of their software. This makes it easy for people to try out their services without having to spend any money. TaxAct also offers a free edition of their software, but it is more limited in terms of features than the one offered by PragmaticPlay.

Another thing to consider is customer service. TaxAct is known for providing excellent customer service, while PragmaticPlay is still working on improving theirs. However, they are quickly catching up to TaxAct in this area.

Overall, both TaxAct and PragmaticPlay are great options for online tax preparation. It really depends on what you need and what your budget is. If you want the best bang for your buck, then PragmaticPlay is probably the better option. However, if you want someone you can rely on to help you with your taxes, then TaxAct is probably the better choice.
