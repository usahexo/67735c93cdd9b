#  Roulette Wheel Has 36 Outcomes, Enough For Any Gambler

The roulette wheel is a popular casino game that has caught the attention of gamblers for centuries. It has a history dating back to the 17th century France, and it’s still one of the most played casino games today. The game is simple. There’s a spinning wheel with 36 numbers on it, numbered from 0 to 35. Players make bets on which number the ball will fall into after the roulette wheel stops spinning.

The beauty of the game is that there are so many potential outcomes, giving players a wide range of betting options.
