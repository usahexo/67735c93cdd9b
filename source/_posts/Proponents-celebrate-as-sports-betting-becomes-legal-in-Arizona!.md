#  Proponents celebrate as sports betting becomes legal in Arizona!

After more than a year of anticipation, sports betting is now legal in the Grand Canyon state. In October, Governor Doug Ducey signed a bill into law that would allow regulated sports betting in Arizona.

The state's casinos wasted no time in getting started, launching their sportsbooks ahead of the NFL's Monday Night Football game between the Washington Redskins and Philadelphia Eagles on October 8.

"We're excited to offer this product to our guests," said Apache Gold Casino General Manager Cody Hoeflich in a statement. "It's another way we can provide a unique and entertaining gaming experience."

Casinos are not the only ones celebrating the new law. Fans of Arizona State Sun Devils and University of Arizona Wildcats athletics are also eagerly anticipating who will be the first to legally bet on a game.

"I'm so happy that it's finally legal to bet on sports here," said Sun Devils fan Darren Sanchez. "ASU is going to crush UA this year, and I can't wait to make some money off of them."

Not everyone is thrilled with the new law, as there have been some concerns raised about its potential impact on addiction and problem gambling. However, many proponents feel that it is a positive development for the state and its economy.

"This is great news for Arizona," said Governor Ducey in a statement after signing the bill into law. "It'll bring people and money into our state, creating jobs and boosting our local businesses."

#  Sports betting finally becomes legal in Arizona – years after other states!

Arizona has been one of the last states to legalize sports betting. This is mainly due to the fact that there was a tribal casino in the state until recently. However, on October 17th, 2018, Proposition 302 was passed, allowing for sports betting to finally become legal in the Grand Canyon State.

The passage of Proposition 302 means that there will be four licensed and regulated sportsbooks operational in Arizona by the start of the 2019 NFL season. These books will be located at the Ak-Chin Indian Community’s Harrah’s Ak-Chin Casino Resort, Talking Stick Resort, Gila River Gaming Enterprises’ Wild Horse Pass Hotel and Casino, and Sunland Park Racetrack and Casino.

While it is great that Arizona residents will now have legal access to sports betting, there are some important things to keep in mind. First and foremost, all bets must be placed through one of the aforementioned licensed sportsbooks. Additionally, you must be at least 21 years old in order to place a bet.

There are also a number of restrictions on what can be bet on. For example, you cannot bet on college games taking place in Arizona. In addition, certain prop bets will not be available (e.g., who will win the coin flip at the beginning of a game).

It remains to be seen whether or not legalizing sports betting will result in an increase in tourism (especially from neighboring states like California and Nevada). However, it is clear that this move should provide a boost for the state’s gaming industry overall.

# State legislators pass bill to legalize sports betting in Arizona

In a unanimous vote on Wednesday, the Arizona state legislature approved a bill that would legalize sports betting in the Grand Canyon State. The measure now moves to Governor Doug Ducey's desk for his signature; he has not indicated whether he will sign it into law.

If enacted, the bill would allow casinos and race tracks in Arizona to offer sports betting, subject to certain regulations. Bettors would be able to wager on professional, collegiate, and amateur sporting events.

Supporters of the bill argue that it would generate much-needed revenue for the state. They point out that other states that have legalized sports betting have seen an increase in tourism and tax revenue.

Opponents of the bill argue that it could lead to increased gambling addiction and other social harms. They also warn that it could jeopardize the integrity of sporting events.

Governor Ducey has not said whether he will sign or veto the bill, but he is expected to make a decision in the coming days.

#  Arizonans can now legally bet on sports – but where?

The long-awaited sports betting bill has finally passed in Arizona, and residents are eager to know where they can place their bets.

HB 2318 allows licensed casinos and off-track betting facilities to offer sports betting. It also allows for mobile and online wagering, giving Arizonans a variety of options when it comes to betting on their favorite teams.

But where can you go to place your bets?

Currently, there are 17 licensed casinos in Arizona, and all of them are expected to offer sports betting once the bill goes into effect later this year.

In addition, there are numerous off-track betting facilities throughout the state. These facilities will also likely offer sports betting, although it's unclear at this point how many will do so.

Finally, Arizonans can also bet on sports through online and mobile platforms. There are numerous licensed offshore operators that cater to US customers, so there's no shortage of options when it comes to placing bets online or on your phone or tablet.

So what's the catch?

There is no catch – other than the fact that you have to be 21 years of age or older in order to place a bet. This new law opens up a whole world of gambling possibilities for residents in Arizona, so be sure to check out the different options available to you and start placing some bets!

#  Sports betting is now legal in Arizona!

On November 5, 2018, Proposition 206 – the Sports Wagering Act – was passed in Arizona, legalizing sports betting in the state. This new law will allow casinos and race tracks to offer sports betting, and individual residents to place wagers on sporting events through mobile apps and websites.

The passage of Proposition 206 has been met with mixed reactions. Supporters of the bill argue that it will create jobs and bring in new tax revenue to the state. Detractors argue that the law is too restrictive and that it will not generate as much revenue as proponents claim.

No matter where you stand on the issue,[카지노 사이트](https://choegocasino.com/) one thing is clear: Arizona is now a sports betting destination. MGM Grand Casino and Resort has already announced plans to open a sports book at its property in Glendale, and other casinos are likely to follow suit.

If you’re interested in betting on sports, here are some things you need to know about the new law:

1. You must be 21 years old or older to place a wager.
2. Wagering is only allowed on professional and college sports, not high school or amateur games.
3. You can only bet on games that have already started – no future bets or parlays allowed.
4. You can place bets at casinos and race tracks, or through authorized mobile apps and websites.
5. The maximum bet you can place is $10 per game.
6. The state will take a 10% cut of all gambling revenue (not just sports betting revenue), which will be used to fund education initiatives.
