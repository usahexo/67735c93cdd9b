#  Multihand blackjack – more ways to win!

Multihand blackjack is an exciting variation of the classic casino game that offers players more opportunities to win. With three hands instead of one, players can increase their chances of landing a winning hand.

The basic rules of multihand blackjack are the same as traditional blackjack. The aim of the game is to beat the dealer by getting closer to 21 than them, without going bust. Players are dealt two cards face up, and the dealer is dealt one face up and one face down. Players can then choose to either hit (draw another card) or stand (stick with what they’ve got). The aim is to get as close to 21 as possible without going over.

If you land a Blackjack (two cards of the same value), you automatically win 1.5 times your bet amount. In multihand blackjack, there are more opportunities to win big payouts thanks to the three hands on offer. If you get a Blackjack in any of your hands, you automatically win 3 times your bet amount!

There are also other bonus payouts available in multihand blackjack. If you get five cards without going bust (a Straight), you’ll win 5 times your bet amount. And if you can get four cards of the same value (a Four-of-a-Kind), you’ll bag yourself a whopping 25 times your bet amount!

Multihand blackjack is a great way to add an extra level of excitement and anticipation to proceedings. With more ways to win, it’s perfect for players who want to increase their chances of walking away with some serious prize money. So why not give it a go today?
