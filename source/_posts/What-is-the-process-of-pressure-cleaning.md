#  What is the process of pressure cleaning?

Pressure cleaning, also called power washing or hydro scrubbing, is the process of using high pressure water to clean a surface. This can be done with a hand-held attachment or with a pressure washer.

The pressure washer is a tool that uses high pressure water to clean surfaces. It can be used to clean cars, sidewalks, decks, and more.

There are two types of pressure washers: electric and gas. Electric pressure washers are powered by electricity, while gas pressure washers are powered by gas.

Electric pressure washers are smaller and lighter than gas pressure washers. Gas pressure washers are more powerful than electric ones.

There are also two types of nozzles: flat and jet. Flat nozzles create a wide spray that is good for cleaning large areas. Jet nozzles create a narrow spray that is good for cleaning tight spaces.

#  What are the benefits of pressure cleaning?

There are many benefits of pressure cleaning including:

-Restoring or increasing the value of your property
-Preventing expensive repairs by removing built-up dirt, mould, and grime
-Making your home or business look clean and new again
-Improving air quality by removing trapped dirt and debris
-Helping to prevent the growth of mould and mildew

#  What surfaces can be pressure cleaned?

When most people think of pressure cleaning, they imagine blasting dirt, dust, and cobwebs from the sides of a house. However, this versatile cleaning technique can also be used on other surfaces, both inside and outside.

Pressure cleaning is great for removing built-up grime from concrete, brick, stone, and stucco surfaces. It can also be used to clean driveways, garages, and patio areas. As an added bonus, it can help get rid of weeds and remove paint or graffiti from hard surfaces.

In addition to traditional pressure cleaners, there are now many portable machines that are perfect for small jobs like cleaning the car or washing windows. Some even have adjustable nozzles so you can choose the right level of pressure for each task.

Just about any surface can be cleaned with a little bit of pressure – but always test in an inconspicuous spot first to make sure the finish won’t be damaged.

#  How often should you pressure clean? 

There is no definitive answer to this question as it depends on a variety of factors, but a good rule of thumb is to pressure clean your home or property at least once a year.

The main reason you should pressure clean your property is to remove built-up dirt, debris, and stains. Over time, these can lead to serious damage to your home or property if not addressed.

Pressure cleaning can also help improve the appearance of your home or property and can increase its value. It’s also a great way to prepare your home for sale or for a major renovation project.

If you have never pressure cleaned your property before, it is important to consult with a professional before getting started. They will be able to assess the condition of your property and recommend the best approach for achieving optimal results.

#  What are the dangers of pressure cleaning?

Pressure washing is a popular way to clean the exterior of a home. It is fast and efficient, but there are some dangers to pressure washing that should be considered before you start.

First, watch out for power lines. NEVER pressure wash under power lines. The force of the water can push debris or wet leaves into the wires, causing a dangerous outage.

Second, be careful around windows, doors and other features of your home. The high pressure of the water can cause them to break or crack.

Finally, be sure to use the correct nozzle for your pressure washer. A wide angle nozzle puts out more water pressure than a narrow one, so be sure to use the right nozzle for the job you are doing. Too much pressure can damage plants, siding and more.
