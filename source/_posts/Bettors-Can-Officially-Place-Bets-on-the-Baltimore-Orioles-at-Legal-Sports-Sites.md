#  Bettors Can Officially Place Bets on the Baltimore Orioles at Legal Sports Sites

For years, baseball bettors have been able to place wagers on games of the World Series and other major league contests. But what about bets on individual games during the regular season? That has not been possible in many states.

That is changing, however, as Maryland’s legislature has just OK’d a bill that allows sports betting at approved venues, including casinos and racetracks. And that means legal online sportsbooks can now offer betting odds on Orioles games at their sites.

This development could provide a much-needed boost to the team, which finished in last place in the American League East Division last year with a record of 75-87. The Orioles are hoping for better things this season with an outfield anchored by new acquisition Mark Trumbo and Manny Machado, who hit over 30 homers last year.

The starting rotation will also be notably stronger this year with the addition of right-hander Kevin Gausman and lefty Wade Miley. However, it is unclear how well these new players will mesh and whether they will be enough to get Baltimore back into contention for a playoff spot.

The current odds at most legal sportsbooks have the Birds opening up the season at around +650 to win the AL East Division (an implied probability of ~15%) and +2000 to win the World Series (an implied probability of ~5%). Those odds may change as we get closer to Opening Day on April 3rd, so make sure you check out our MLB Odds page frequently for updates.

In any case, it is now finally legal to bet on Orioles games through approved online sportsbooks, so be sure to check out the latest betting lines and make your picks!

#  Sports Betting Now Legal in Maryland - Orioles Fans rejoice!

Believe it or not, but as of October 1, 2018 sports betting is now legal in Maryland. This after the state's General Assembly overrode Governor Larry Hogan's veto of a bill legalizing the activity.

The new law allows for both in-person and online sports betting, subject to regulation by the state's lottery commission.

Orioles fans are likely rejoicing at the news, as they can now legally place bets on their favorite team. The same is likely true for fans of other Maryland sports teams, such as the Washington Capitals and Redskins, as well as college teams such as Maryland Terrapins and Navy Midshipmen.

So far it is not clear how much revenue legalized sports betting will generate for Maryland. However, some analysts are predicting that it could be in the hundreds of millions of dollars per year. This would be a big boost for the state, which is facing significant budget deficits.

It remains to be seen how popular sports betting will be in Maryland. However, there is no doubt that this new law provides a lot of opportunities for gambling enthusiasts in the state. Whether you are a fan of the Ravens, Orioles, Caps or Skins, now is your chance to place some bets on their games!

#  Sports Betting is Finally Legal in Maryland - including Orioles games!

After years of anticipation, sports betting is finally legal in Maryland. Governor Larry Hogan signed the bill into law on Friday, September 21st, making it the seventh state to legalize sports betting since the Supreme Court overturned the federal ban in May.

The new law allows bettors to wager on professional and college sports, including games involving the Orioles. This is great news for fans of the team, who can now place bets on game outcomes and other related props.

Online sports betting sites will be up and running in Maryland in time for the start of the NFL season. In addition to traditional wagers on games, such as point spreads and moneylines, bettors will be able to gamble on prop bets such as first touchdown scorer and total points scored.

Sports betting has long been popular in other countries, such as the United Kingdom and Australia, but has been banned in the US since 1992. However, with the Supreme Court’s ruling in May, states have been free to legalize sports betting if they choose to do so.

Some states have been more eager to legalize sports betting than others. Delaware was the first state to take advantage of the new ruling, launching its sportsbook within minutes of the Supreme Court’s decision. Since then, six other states have followed suit: New Jersey, West Virginia, Mississippi, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, and now Maryland.

Legalized sports betting is expected to bring in significant revenue for states that choose to legalize it. In New Jersey alone, it is estimated that sports betting will generate $216 million in revenue annually. This could provide a much-needed boost for cash-strapped states like Maryland.

Whether you’re a seasoned pro or just getting started with sports betting, there’s something for everyone at Maryland’s newly legalized casinos and online sportsbooks. So get out there and start placing some bets!
