Skunks, raccoons, and other critters can often take up residence in dirty areas, and a power wash can get rid of them quickly and easily.\n\n#  What are the best times to pressure wash?\n\nThere is no definitive answer to this question as the best time to pressure wash will vary depending on the individual and the specific project. However, there are some general guidelines that can be followed.\n\nIn general, the best time to pressure wash is when the weather is mild and there is little chance of rain. This will help ensure that the area being washed stays dry and that the equipment does not get damaged. Additionally, it is important to avoid washing areas that are covered in pollen or other allergens, as this can cause respiratory issues.\n\nIf you are cleaning a concrete surface, it is best to wait until the surface has completely dried before pressure washing. This will help avoid damaging the surface and creating a mess.\n\nIf you are unsure about whether or not it is safe to pressure wash an area, it is always best to speak with a professional before beginning any project.\n\n#  What surfaces can be safely pressure washed?\n\nPressure washing is a great way to clean surfaces around your home, and it can be a relatively easy task when you know which surfaces can be safely pressure washed.\n\nBefore starting, it’s important to read the manufacturer’s instructions for your pressure washer. Different types of surfaces and materials may require different pressures and nozzle settings.\n\nThere are many exterior surfaces that can be safely pressure washed, including: vinyl siding, wood decks, concrete patios, asphalt driveways, and metal sheds. Be sure to avoid power washing painted surfaces or surfaces with delicate finishes, like stucco or brick.\n\nWhen cleaning vinyl siding, use a low-pressure setting and a fan-type nozzle to avoid damage. Start at the bottom of the siding and work your way up. For wood decks, use a moderate pressure setting and a straight-nozzle spray pattern. Be careful not to let the water pool on the deck; instead, allow it to run off into the yard.\n\nConcrete patios can be easily cleaned with a moderate pressure setting and a fan-type nozzle. Start in one corner of the patio and work your way across. Asphalt driveways can also be cleaned with moderate pressure and a fan-type nozzle. Rinse the driveway thoroughly after cleaning to remove any detergent residue.\n\nFinally, metal sheds can be easily cleaned with a high-pressure setting and either a circular or cone-type nozzle. Be sure to avoid hitting the shed with too much force, as this could cause damage.\n\n#  What types of detergents or cleaners work best with a pressure washer?\n\nThere are a number of detergents and cleaners that can be used with a pressure washer. Some of the most popular include Simple Green, Greased Lightning, Purple Power, and Fantastik. There are also many other brands and options available.\n\nWhen selecting a detergent or cleaner to use with a pressure washer, it is important to consider the type of surface you will be cleaning. For example, if you are cleaning a concrete driveway, you will want to use a degreaser or cleaner that is specifically designed for concrete. If you are cleaning a deck, you will want to use a cleaner that is designed for wood decks.\n\nIt is also important to read the instructions carefully when using a detergent or cleaner with a pressure washer. Many of these products can be dangerous if not used properly.","source":"_posts/What-are-the-5-benefits-of-pressure-washing.md","raw":"---\ntitle: What are the 5 benefits of pressure washing\ndate: 2022-08-16 18:40:38\ncategories:\n- Pressure Washing\ntags:\n---\n\n\n#  What are the 5 benefits of pressure washing?\n\n1.
